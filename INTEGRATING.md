# Integrating applications with MetalK8s

> _NOTE_: this document is a summary of the more detailed documentation,
> currently available at [`docs/solutions/`](docs/solutions/index.rst).

With a focus on having minimal human actions required, both in its deployment
and operation, MetalK8s also intends to ease deployment and operation of complex
applications, named _**Solutions**_, on its cluster.

This document defines what a _Solution_ refers to, the responsibilities of each
party in this integration, and will link to relevant documentation pages for
detailed information.

## What is a _Solution_?

We use the term _**Solution**_ to describe a packaged Kubernetes application,
archived as an ISO disk image, containing:

- A set of OCI images to inject in MetalK8s image registry
- An Operator, in [the terms introduced by CoreOS](
  https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html), to deploy on the cluster
- Optionally, a UI for managing and monitoring the application, represented by a
  standard Kubernetes `Deployment`

Once a Solution is deployed on MetalK8s, a user can start creating the
appropriate `CustomResource`s defined by the Solution Operator, using either
the Solution UI or the Kubernetes API, to effectively deploy one or more
instances of the application packaged in the Solution.

## Responsibilities of each party

This section intends to define the boundaries between MetalK8s and the Solutions
to integrate with, in terms of "who is doing what?".

_**NOTE**: this is still a work in progress._

### MetalK8s

**MUST**:
- Handle reading and mounting of the Solution ISO archive
- Provide tooling to deploy a Solution's Operator and UI
- Provide tooling to upgrade a Solution's Operator and UI

**MAY**:
- Provide tooling to verify signatures in a Solution ISO
- Expose management of Solutions in its own UI

### Solution

**MUST**:
- Comply with the standard archive structure defined by MetalK8s
- Comply with the `CustomResource`s standards defined by MetalK8s
- Set up its own monitoring

**MAY**:
- Use MetalK8s monitoring services (Prometheus and Grafana)

## Interaction diagrams

We include detailed interaction sequence diagrams for describing how MetalK8s
will handle user input when deploying / upgrading Solutions.

### Solution deployment

See [solutions/deployment.uml](docs/solutions/deployment.uml).

### Solution upgrade

`TODO`
